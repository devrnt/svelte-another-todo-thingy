# Te doen

Just exploring Svelte, stores and contexts with a clich√© todo app. [Site](https://svelte-another-todo-thingy.vercel.app/)

**Findings**

- Stores are just awesome, such a useful/powerful out of the box approach for state management
- The need to specify a key for the context feels like a step too much, feels like could be done by Svelte itself
